### **User Testing**

After the completetion and final deployment of the website, I sent a link over to family, friends and colleagues. Some of them used the website on their phones, some on their tablets and some on their computers. Everybody was happy with how the website performed, how it was designed and its responsivenes.

### **Manual Testing**

There was ongoing testing throughout the whole development of the website. I was using the Google Developer Tools to troubleshoot issues as well as performing early deployments to see if everything on the website was functioning the way it was expected.

I also used the Google Developer Tools console to work on some of the smaller sections of the JavaScript code, also console logging the computer and user choices to check to see if they are assigned the expected values, trying different functions in the console, and using typeof to check to see if the parseInt() function was working as expected.
