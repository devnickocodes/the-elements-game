# **The Elements Game - Portfolio Project 2**

The Elements Game is a website that is based on the concept of rock, paper, scissors, but I thought of tweaking it a little bit and, instead use four elements: Fire, Water, Air and Ice. The game is played between the player and the computer, where the computer will choose one of the elements on a random principle and the player will choose one element themselves. Depending on both participants' decisions a point is rewarded to the winner of the round. Whoever gets to 10 points first wins the Trophy!

The objective for this project is to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a front-end website that interacts with the users' actions and with their choices so that they are able to play the game. Another objective for the website is to be really responsive and accessible as well as easy to navigate through.

## **UX & Design**

### **Creator Stories**

- I want the player to be able to easily make their choice for each one of the elements.
- I want this website to be responsive on many devices.
- I want this website to be very accessible.
- I want the player to freely navigate through the website without any issues.
- I want the user to be able to see the scoreboard and how many points they have.
- I want the player to easily see the announcements for Win/Loss/Draw depending on whoever gets to 10 points first or in the case of a draw where both participants reached 10 points at the same time.
- I want the player to easily find and open the instructions on how to play the game and exit the instructions without affecting the game.

### **Wireframes**

The fundamental design for the home page, the announcements tabs as well as the how to play tab was created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).
