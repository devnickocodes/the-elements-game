# **The Elements Game - Portfolio Project 2**

The Elements Game is a website that is based on the concept of rock, paper, scissors, but I thought of tweaking it a little bit and, instead use four elements: Fire, Water, Air and Ice. The game is played between the player and the computer, where the computer will choose one of the elements on a random principle and the player will choose one element themselves. Depending on both participants' decisions a point is rewarded to the winner of the round. Whoever gets to 10 points first wins the Trophy!

The objective for this project is to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a front-end website that interacts with the users' actions and with their choices so that they are able to play the game. Another objective for the website is to be really responsive and accessible as well as easy to navigate through.
